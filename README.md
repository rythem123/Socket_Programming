#Client-Server Architecture
Client-server architecture, architecture of a computer network in which many clients (remote processors) 
request and receive service from a centralized server (host computer).
This is a very naive implementation of broadcasting over a network.
To run this ,type python -u "client_server_messaging.py" and then "Client_messaging.py" in another terminal.
